# TODO - Meow Widget Development

## Current State
- Rust-based system status bar built with Ratatui
- Three main components displayed horizontally: Workspaces, Time, SystemBar
- SystemBar aggregates temperature, CPU, RAM, brightness, volume, and battery
- Individual component files exist but aren't being used (CPU, RAM, Battery as standalone)
- Linux-specific dependencies (hyprctl, wpctl, brightnessctl)
- No tests currently

## Next Steps

### 1. Architecture Improvements
- [x] Refactor SystemBar to use the individual component modules instead of duplicating logic
- [ ] Implement a proper component registry/composition pattern
- [ ] Add configuration system for layout customization

### 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- [ ] Address the sysinfo dependency concern noted in Cargo.toml
- [ ] Add OS detection and conditional system calls
- [ ] Implement fallbacks for missing commands/tools

### 3. Features & Enhancements
- [ ] Add network connectivity monitoring
- [ ] Implement weather display
- [ ] Add system notifications/alerts
- [ ] Create interactive elements (click to switch workspaces, adjust volume)
- [ ] Add theming support

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Implement error handling improvements
- [ ] Add logging system
- [ ] Documentation

### 5. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Reduce system call frequency with caching
- [ ] Implement async updates
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
