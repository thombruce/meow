# Catfood =^,^=

A modular utility suite for system management, built with Rust and Ratatui.

## Usage

### System Bar

Run the system bar:

Top of screen:
```sh
kitten panel catfood bar
```

Bottom of screen:
```sh
kitten panel --edge=bottom catfood bar
```

### Other Commands

```sh
catfood bar           # Run the system bar
catfood menu          # Run the menu system (coming soon)
catfood notifications # Run notification system (coming soon)
```

## Installation

### From crates.io

```sh
# Install the complete catfood suite
cargo install catfood

# Install just the bar component
cargo install catfood-bar
```

### From Source

```sh
# Build and install all utilities
cargo install --path .

# Or build and run locally
cargo run --release -- bar
```

## Configuration

catfood supports live configuration via `~/.config/catfood/bar.json`. The first time you run the application, a default configuration file will be created.

### Hot-Reload

Configuration changes are automatically detected and applied without restarting the application. Simply edit your `bar.json` file and the bar layout will update in real-time!

### Error Logging

All errors are logged to `~/.local/share/catfood/logs/bar.log` in ISO format:
```
2025-12-21T03:45:12Z [ERROR] [COMPONENT_WORKSPACES] Error: Failed to get workspaces
2025-12-21T03:45:13Z [ERROR] [CONFIG] Failed to reload configuration: ...
2025-12-21T03:45:14Z [ERROR] [FILE_WATCHER] Failed to create file watcher: ...
```

The log file keeps only the last 1000 lines.

See [CONFIG_EXAMPLE.md](CONFIG_EXAMPLE.md) for detailed configuration options and examples.

## Release Process

This project uses automated releases triggered by git tags:

### Making a Release

1. **Update Version** (using conventional commits):
   ```bash
   # Bump version and update workspace
   cargo release patch  # or minor/major
   ```

2. **Create Tag**:
   ```bash
   # Tag the release (must be on main branch)
   git tag v0.1.1
   git push --tags
   ```

3. **Automatic Release**:
   - GitHub Actions builds and tests on all platforms
   - Binaries are compiled for Linux, macOS, and Windows
   - Workspace is published to crates.io concurrently
   - GitHub Release is created with binaries and changelog

### Development Workflow

Use conventional commit messages for automatic changelog generation:

- `feat: add new weather component` → New features
- `fix: memory leak in CPU monitoring` → Bug fixes  
- `docs: update configuration examples` → Documentation
- `refactor: improve component performance` → Code improvements

### Release Types

- **Patch (0.1.1)**: Bug fixes, documentation updates
- **Minor (0.2.0)**: New features, significant enhancements
- **Major (1.0.0)**: Breaking changes, API changes
